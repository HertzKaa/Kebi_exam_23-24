# **Personalized Menu â€“ Knowledge-Based Food Recommendation System**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Many modern restaurants offer digital menus accessible via QR codes. However, large menus are often difficult to navigate on small smartphone screens, especially for guests with specific dietary preferences or food allergies.

The **Personalized Menu** project addresses this challenge by developing a system that filters and recommends only the meals suited to each guest's needs. This solution uses multiple knowledge-based approaches to model meals, ingredients, guest profiles, and preferences.

The system focuses on typical Italian restaurant offerings such as pizza, pasta, and main courses, considering various ingredients and their properties (e.g., type, allergens, calories).
